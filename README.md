## Features  
- **Game Update Support**:  
  The launcher enables seamless game updates for Test Drive Unlimited 2. You can now keep your game up-to-date with the latest patches and improvements, ensuring optimal performance and access to new features. The update process is simple and user-friendly, making it easy for players to always have the latest version of the game.

- **Cloud Savegame Sync**:  
  Our launcher provides a cloud savegame feature, allowing you to upload and download your game progress with ease. Whether you're switching between devices or just want to keep your save files safe, the cloud functionality ensures that your game saves are securely stored and easily accessible when needed.

- **Local Backup Function**:  
  A local backup feature has been added. You can now choose whether to create a savepoint before or after playing (dynamic list, freely selectable). The launcher will create as many backups as you specify, overwriting old ones once the limit is reached. This ensures that you can easily restore your progress if needed, without worrying about losing your saved data.

- **Mod Browser**:  
  The launcher comes with an integrated mod browser, making it easier than ever to discover, install, and manage mods for Test Drive Unlimited 2. With just a few clicks, you can enhance your gameplay experience with community-created content such as new cars, tracks, and other customizations. No need to manually search or install modsâ€”everything is streamlined within the launcher.

- **Game Repair**:  
  Encountering errors with your game installation? The launcher includes a built-in tool that checks for corrupted or missing files and automatically repairs them. This ensures that any issues with your current game installation are fixed quickly, allowing you to get back to playing without the hassle of reinstalling or troubleshooting.

- **Project Paradise 2 Online Support**:  
  One of the most exciting features of this launcher is the restoration of online functionality via the **Project Paradise 2 server**. This allows you to once again play Test Drive Unlimited 2 online, connecting with other players, racing, and enjoying the multiplayer features that the game has to offer. Say goodbye to the days of offline-only gameplay!
  Please note, however, that this launcher does **not** include the required server connection for authorization to access the online mode. The online functionality is only available with the version I have provided, which includes the necessary server connection for authentication.

- **Open Source**:  
  This launcher is fully open-source, meaning that the community is encouraged to contribute, improve, and customize the code. We welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from players and developers alike to keep the launcher growing and evolving. You can access the source code on our official repository and help make the project even better!
